# Agent Guidelines

- Tailwind CSS (via CDN) is used for styling across the site. Prefer Tailwind utility classes and avoid other CSS frameworks.
- Record any additional project decisions or conventions in this file.
- No automated tests are configured; run `npm test` to confirm.
- Removed obsolete `cold.html` panel.
- Navigation links now live in a Tailwind-styled sidebar instead of a top bar.
- Toggle controls should use Tailwind switch-style buttons with a sliding knob.
